## Project Description

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project employs data science techniques to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying cancerous cases based on various clinical and diagnostic features.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** (WBCD), which contains the following features:

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension
- Class (Malignant or Benign)
